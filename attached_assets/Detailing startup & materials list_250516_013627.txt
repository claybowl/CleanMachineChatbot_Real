CHEMICALS- 

Try to buy the 1 or 5 gallon, usually dilutable, but not always. Get these from Professional Cleaning Supply in Tulsa for cheaper than online usually, but check anyway. 

Technician's Choice - Grape n Glow soap

Technician's Choice - Orange Crush, your main cleaner for most things

Technician's Choice - Vision glass cleaner 

Technician's Choice - Wheels, wheel cleaner.

Technician's Choice Acid wheel cleaner MUUCH better, but learn how to use it first or you WILL ruin someone's expensive aluminum rims. Look this up and ask at the store.

Platinum PCW60 Leather conditioner (always apply this to leather if you use a cleaner on it to replace moisture the cleaner removes)

Technician's Choice - Blue Velvet Tire dressing 

Optional offering - Gorilla Guard Fabric protector or Leather Boost leather protector charge $35-50 per car depending on size (both at PCS)

Technician's Choice - Bug-A-Boo bug remover for front end/windshield/rearview mirrors. Can use orange crush, but doesn't work as well. 

Technician's Choice Ceramic detail spray -$30-40 https://a.co/d/fpniHOi

Technician's Choice blue sapphire interior dressing 

Technician's Choice - Leather cleaner (can get away with using orange crush, but it's not ideal as it pulls lots of oils out of leather so aim to upgrade when you can afford to)

Technicians Choice - leather scent (optional, but nice)

POLISHING/HEADLIGHTS -

Don't stress about polishing yet unless it to polish headlights. For headlights- (I charge $25 per lens) Get a cheap DA (dual action) polisher on Amazon/harbor freight and use 1500 then 3000 grit sanding pads on Polisher then move to a microfiber pad with Gorilla Cut Hi-Cut compound, all at PCS. Shouldn't take more than 5-10 minutes per lens at once you get the hang of it. Eventually you may consider getting a nice polisher, I recommend the Rupes Bigfoot mk3. Either 5 or 6in. 5in can fit in some smaller areas, while 6in covers more area at a time so you can work faster. Next get a small 2-3 polisher for tights spots. They get pricey, but consider the cordless if you can afford it. Could also get an older used model that still works like a charm for cheaper. 

Gorilla Cut Compound for deep paint correction 

Nasiol clear rub 505 especially for soft black paint or anything that I want perfect after compound.

Rupes Uno-Advanced 1 year ceramic polish- This is my one year ceramic coat service, easy to polish and apply the coating in one step. Upsell this for an additional $150 on top of your detail service. Better protection than wax, more glossy, more hydrophobic and makes cleaning a breeze at the drive-through wash.

Amazon Ozone Generator for odor removal, cigarette smoke, mildew/water smell, vomit, pet smells including urine. It works so long as whatever is causing the odor has been cleaned/ removed first. I charge $50 for 3hrs or $75 for 5 hrs. Leave it running in the can and come back to pick it up. Always open doors to let gas air out for a few minutes before leaving, ozone gas can irritate your throat.
