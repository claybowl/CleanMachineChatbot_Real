Ceramic Coatings
Ceramic Coatings offer the best paint protection and gloss available on the market today. Including our 1 or 2-step polish, a true SiO2 coating is certainly the best thing you can do for the health and appearance of your vehicle.

1-Year $300

3-year $750

Features:
In addition to helping prevent dirt from sticking to the paint, which keeps the vehicle cleaner for longer between washes, SiO2 coatings act as a 'Super-Wax', so you don't need to apply waxes throughout it's lifetime. Our coating offers 3-5 years of protection from UV and sun, weather erosion and acid rain, tree gunk and bird droppings all while providing more gloss than the the finest waxes.

Process:
We first employ the foam cannon to suds up the vehicle in a thick biodegradable, neutral PH snow foam and gently hand wash the entire vehicle using the scratch- free two-bucket method. Then we'll impliment both clay mitt mechanical decontamination and chemical rust removal treatments.

Next, using the industry 'gold standard' Rupes Bigfoot Dual-Action Polisher in conjunction with the appropriate pad/polish combination for your vehicle, we'll polish the paint to a buttery smooth, glossy finish to ensure the highest quality bond before the ceramic coating is hand applied to all exterior painted surfaces and wheel faces.
